# Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning

In Assignment 1, I executed intricate models,optimized polynomial linear regression, employed ridge regression for regularization, and applied diverse classifiers (Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors) on targeted datasets for a complex model design and analysis.

In Assignement 2, Implemented custom LDA, PCA and DBSCAN, compared their performances with K-Means and proposed optimisation techniques.
